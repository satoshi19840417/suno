# Emotion Scene Patterns (15s / 16:9)

Use these as reusable structures. Adapt characters and setting freely.

## Pattern A: Confrontation -> Separation -> Silence

- Cut 1 (0.0-5.0s): Two people face each other; tension rises; one decisive action.
- Cut 2 (5.0-10.0s): Camera switches to the hurt person; tears or restrained expression; they leave frame.
- Cut 3 (10.0-15.0s): Remaining person alone; lowered gaze; stillness; quiet fade.

Best for:
- Breakup scenes
- Friendship rupture
- Family conflict aftermath

## Pattern B: Tears Held Back -> Upward Gaze -> Light Ending

- Cut 1 (0.0-5.0s): Close-up of trembling face; breathing and eye movement carry emotion.
- Cut 2 (5.0-9.5s): Subject looks down and tries not to cry; emotion peaks internally.
- Cut 3 (9.5-13.0s): Subject raises face to sky/light source; shift from collapse to endurance.
- Cut 4 (13.0-15.0s): Bright ending image (sun, window glow, overexposed highlights).

Best for:
- Resilience moments
- Personal setback
- Quiet emotional release without breakdown

## Pattern C: Effort -> Failure -> Frustration -> Aftermath

- Cut 1 (0.0-3.5s): Focused work setup (desk, notes, routine action).
- Cut 2 (3.5-6.5s): Failure reveal moment (result notification, rejection, missed chance).
- Cut 3 (6.5-10.5s): Frustration action (objects pushed away, abrupt movement).
- Cut 4 (10.5-13.0s): Secondary character reaction or environmental pause.
- Cut 5 (13.0-15.0s): Symbolic closing shot of aftermath (discarded items, empty seat).

Best for:
- Exam/job audition failure
- Goal collapse narrative
- Character-breaking turning points

## Pattern D: Distance -> Reflection -> Small Hope

- Cut 1 (0.0-5.0s): Subject isolated in public space; crowd passes without connection.
- Cut 2 (5.0-10.0s): Reflection shot (mirror, train window, phone black screen).
- Cut 3 (10.0-15.0s): Subtle forward motion (step forward, look up, soft sunrise).

Best for:
- Recovery arcs
- Post-conflict transition
- Endings with restrained hope

## Camera and Emotion Rules

- Prioritize face, hands, and posture over dramatic action.
- Keep movement minimal unless the script requires impact.
- Let the final 1-2 seconds hold a clear emotional aftertaste.
